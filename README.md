# Design and development of an embedded system for spatial orientation monitoring
This paper has been written with the aim of measuring and displaying the spatial orientation of a remote controlled car. The data captured by the IMU of Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense is sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy and gets displayed through two different widgets: the first one is a bidimensional inclinometer in which are shown a front and a side view of the RC car animated by roll and pitch, respectively. The second widget consists in a three dimensional view of a .gbl model of an offroad car which rotates in the three dimensional space using the rotation angles of yaw, pitch and roll measured by Arduino Nano.
